# Model cards

The model cards have been proposed in a [Google research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993) in order to help organize facts related to machine learning models in a structured way. Few examples model cards can be found on the Google Cloud's [page](https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/about), and have been adopted by services like [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-cards).

The model cards metadata documents have been introduced by TensorFlow's [Model Card Toolkit](https://www.tensorflow.org/responsible_ai/model_card_toolkit/guide) for streamlining and automate generation of model cards.
